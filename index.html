           There is only one Muskoka. It is a special place<br>
          where rugged granite outcrops and lonely windswept pines<br>
          meet the shimmering beauty of freshwater lakes.<br>
          Unspoiled natural beauty is what people find here<br>
          in Muskoka. This place is our home.<br>
          It is at the heart of what we brew.<br>
